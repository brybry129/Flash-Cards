# Flash Cards

*In Progress*

Flash Cards is a program built in Python using TKinter and Pandas to help learn a new langugae. It is currently only set up to learn French and includes a csv of 102 words in both French and English. It will show you the French word first and after 3 seconds the card will flip to show the English word. Selecting the red X or green checkmark will mark the card as either you getting wrong or getting it correct respectively. After going through all 102 words it will make a new csv of the words you marked incorrectly. The next time you run the program it will ask you if you want to continue where you left off. Selecting yes will have the program only go through the words you previously marked as getting incorrect.

*Planned Future Updates*

 - Create your own flash card sets to study with
 - Choose which side of the card shows first
 - Choose the time to flip the card
